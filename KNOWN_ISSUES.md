# Known Issues and Solutions

## Node.js Deprecation Warning

**Issue**: You may see the following warning in the frontend development console:
```
(node:21876) [DEP0060] DeprecationWarning: The `util._extend` API is deprecated. Please use Object.assign() instead.
```

**Cause**: This warning comes from older Node.js dependencies that still use the deprecated `util._extend` API.

**Impact**: This is just a warning and does not affect the functionality of the application.

**Solutions**:
1. **Immediate**: The warning can be safely ignored as it doesn't impact functionality
2. **Long-term**: Update dependencies when newer versions become available
3. **Suppress Warning**: Add `--no-deprecation` flag to npm scripts if needed

## Fixed Issues

### ✅ Rock Detection API Error (Fixed)
- **Issue**: "Failed to detect rocks" error with JSON serialization
- **Cause**: DateTime objects in API responses couldn't be serialized to JSON
- **Solution**: Updated `DetectionResult.timestamp` field to use ISO string format instead of datetime object
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - API now working correctly

### ✅ File Access Errors (Fixed)
- **Issue**: Windows file locking preventing temporary file cleanup
- **Solution**: Switched from temporary files to in-memory image processing
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - File handling now works properly on Windows

## Current Status

- ✅ **Backend API**: Fully operational on `http://localhost:8000`
- ✅ **Frontend**: Running on `http://localhost:3001`
- ✅ **Rock Detection**: Working correctly (tested with 72.8% confidence detection)
- ✅ **All ML Models**: Loaded successfully (XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Network, YOLO)
- ✅ **WebSocket**: Real-time communication active
- ⚠️ **Minor**: Node.js deprecation warning (non-critical)
